Eclipse / Zend Studio "optimal defaults" settings
==================================================
I've always hated setting up EclipsePDT or Zend Studio after clean install. So I spent some time on trying and exporting the settings, after small changes.
Here are the settings I believe are neccesary to make after starting EclipsePDT/ZS for the first time.

How to import the settings?
------------------------------
1. File -> Import -> General -> Preferences
2. Select the epf file, verify that "Import all is checked" and click finish 


Color theme

- Grenadine - by Tomáš Fejfar http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=261
